  "prompt": "You are an AI assistant tasked with summarizing a chapter from the book. Follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Identify the chapter's main audience and purpose:\n   - Start your summary by stating who the intended readers are and what the chapter aims to achieve.\n   - Focus on the problem the chapter addresses and how it benefits the reader.\n\n2. Highlight the key insights and recommendations, adhering to the \"informational style\":\n   - Use concise sentences. Eliminate filler words, clichés, and vague expressions.\n   - Replace passive voice and nominalizations with active verbs wherever possible.\n   - Provide exact figures and concrete examples mentioned in the chapter.\n\n3. Ensure that each paragraph follows a logical \"from simple to complex\" progression:\n   - Begin with broad ideas or theses.\n   - Gradually dive into details, evidence, or subpoints.\n   - Keep paragraphs short (no more than 3–4 lines each).\n\n4. Structure the summary with clear headings and subheadings (if appropriate):\n   - Use bullet points or numbered lists when summarizing multiple recommendations.\n   - If the chapter includes actual case studies or examples, briefly describe each using the format:\n     • Context: who/what and why.\n     • Action: what was done or recommended.\n     • Outcome: conclusions, results, or metrics.\n   - Maintain a consistent and logical flow.\n\n5. Craft a compelling summary headline:\n   - It should clearly reflect the chapter's value proposition.\n   - Use active verbs or numbers if possible (e.g., \"How to Remove 'Textual Trash': Top 5 Tips\").\n   - Keep it short and engaging.\n\n6. Preserve an honest and respectful tone throughout:\n   - Do not exaggerate or misrepresent facts.\n   - Avoid manipulative language.  \n   - Write as if speaking to a knowledgeable peer—be direct and friendly.\n\n7. Perform a final edit of your summary:\n   - Read it aloud to ensure smoothness and clarity.\n   - Shorten any overly long sentences by splitting them.\n   - Verify that no filler words, unnecessary commas, or vague phrases remain.\n\nNow, based on the provided chapter text below, generate a concise, coherent summary that follows these rules. Begin with a one-sentence audience/purpose statement, then structure the body with the chapter's main points, and end with a brief conclusion that ties back to the reader's benefit.\n",
